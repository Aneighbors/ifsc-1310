  <p>My dog Chunks is a 12 year old chocolate lab. He has been like a child for my husband and I. We got him after being married for just a year. He is getting old a grey. One of the <em>funniest</em> things he has ever said is, <q>Bark bark, barkey bark</q> He is a real hoot if you ever get the chance to meet him.
  
  <h2>Chunk's Routine</h2>

    <li>Comes in to eat breakfast</li>
    <li>Naps</li>
    <li>Wants back out to bark at birds</li>
    <li>Naps and plays until dinner</li>
    <li>Back to bed</li>

<p>Dogs may not speak English but they are constantly communicating through growls, bark, whines, and body language. <blockquote>“Dogs do speak, but only to those who know how to listen.”– <cite> Orhan Pamuk</cite></blockquote> Never have more true words been spoken. If you dont have a dog you should really get one. They are truly man's best friend.
