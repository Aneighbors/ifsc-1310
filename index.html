  <<h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement it all about the content of a website. The article describes progressive enhancement as a peanut M&M with the largest center part of the M&M being the content (HTML), the next layer is the CSS and finally the outer shell is JavaScript. With content being the center of progressive enhancement, this allows you to reach more people. Your other layers may not be visible in older browsers or maybe on mobile devices, but your content will be accessible and in the end this is what matters.</p>
<p>I also read the following article: ‘What is Progressive Enhancement, and why it matters’ by Praveen Dubey. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/
To me this article sums up what progressive enhancement is a little more clearer than the ‘A list Apart.’ By using progressive enhancement, websites can reach more people by allowing them access to the basic content and functionality no matter the browser they are using or how good their internet connection is. This also allows those with more advanced browser software and greater internet the enhanced version of the site. By doing this you’re not just catering your website to one or the other group, you can create a website for all to use. This creates a stable environment across all browsers and devices.
